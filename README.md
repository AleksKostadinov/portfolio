# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio site created to showcase my latest projects.

I utilize AWS S3 to store objects and AWS RDS to host my PostgreSQL database.

The project is deployed on DigitalOcean using Gunicorn and Nginx.

An admin panel is utilized to add projects and information dynamically.
